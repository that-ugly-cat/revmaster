### Category 1: Observational vs Experimental 
- Observational study: These studies involve observing and collecting data on individuals or groups without intervening in any way. 
- Experimental study: These studies involve manipulating one or more variables to determine their effect on an outcome. Examples include randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies. 

### Category 2: Descriptive vs Analytical 
- Descriptive study: These studies describe the characteristics of a particular group or population, without attempting to establish cause-and-effect relationships. 
- Analytical study: These studies attempt to establish cause-and-effect relationships between variables. Examples include case-control studies and cohort studies. 

### Category 3: Qualitative vs quantitative 
- Qualitative study: These studies use non-numerical data such as interviews, focus groups, and observations to explore subjective experiences, attitudes, and beliefs. 
- Quantitative study: These studies use numerical data and statistical analysis to test hypotheses and make predictions. 
- Mixed methods study: These studies use both qualitative and quantitative approaches 

### Category 4: Longitudinal vs Cross-sectional 
- Longitudinal study: These studies follow individuals or groups over an extended period to study changes in behavior or health outcomes over time. 
- Cross-sectional study: These studies collect data at a single point in time to study the prevalence or distribution of a particular condition or behavior in a population.
